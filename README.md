# Moo :cow:

Welcome to `Moo`, a real-time Social Networking Site (SNS) built with React and Firebase. 

## Overview
`Moo` is not your ordinary SNS. It is built with real-time functionality in mind. This means when you post something, other users can instantly see your posts without having to refresh their page. This leads to a more interactive and engaging experience for all users.

## Technology
`Moo` is built using the following technologies:
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase:** A platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.

Together, these technologies allow `Moo` to be a fast, efficient, and real-time SNS.
