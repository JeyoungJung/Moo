When you use Firebase/ Amplify, you are basically marrying Google or Amazon.

So wouldn't use in a REAL project.

Migrating away from firebase would be real pain.

When you are using firebase you are "renting" Google's database.

Which can be good when you are testing your ideas.

You use this when you want to test your idea as fast as possible.

You can go really far just using Firebase.
